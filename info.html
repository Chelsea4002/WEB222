                <p>
                    <strong>Blue Marble</strong> is a board game developed by <strong>C-Art co.</strong> in 1982 
                    and the name is derived from the title of a photograph taken of the Earth from the Apollo spacecraft.
                    C-Art company was originally a design company, but the CEO of C-Art company Lee Sang-bae was agonizing over the poor business of printing promotional materials at the time, 
                    and he created a new board game with the motif of one of popular board games, <strong>Monopoly</strong>.
                    When Blue Marble was first released in Korea, it didn't sell well because of its high price.
                    It began to become popular due to its strategy of making and selling inexpensive entry-level games and became a best-selling product.

                    <p>
                        After placing the game board in the middle, each person get the same amount of money. 
                        Put every player's spaceship at the starting point and place mixed golden key cards on the game board.
                    </p>
                    <li>How to play the game?</li>
                    <p>
                        Roll two dice at each turn and move clockwise by the sum of the scales. 
                        If the destination is city, player can decide whether purchasing the certificate of the city or not. 
                        At this time, certificates already purchased by others cannot be purchased again. 
                        If two dice come in the same number, player gets one more turn.
                        <br>
                        In each player's turn, player can pay the bank according to the amount written on the certificate and build a villa, building, or hotel.
                        Building a better building increases the value of the city certificate the player purchased.
                        <br>
                        When the player enters a city owned by someone else, that player has to pay a toll.
                        If the property you have is less than the toll you have to pay, 
                        you must sell your building to the bank or hand over the building and certificate to the other party. 
                        If you can't pay the toll, you'll go bankrupt and get eliminated from the game.
                    </p>
                        <li>When the game ends?</li>
                    <p>
                        If everyone but one person goes bankrupt, the game ends and the survivor wins.

                <p>
                    In my experience, <u>buying a lot of city certificates and owning as many buildings as possible</u> is a winning strategy.
                    You may feel uneasy about purchasing city certificates and building buildings in case you have to pay tolls on land purchased by other players.
                    However, since you can sell the building or sell city certificates if you don't have enough money, don't worry too much about the worst case in advance.
                    Hope this tip can help you to become a winner!
